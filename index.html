            <p>This is a picture of my favorite place on Earth:</p>
            <h3>Grand Teton National Park</h3>
            <img src="Images/Tetons-Unsplash.jpg">
            <p>Here are some of my own pictures from over the years:</p>
            <h3>My 18th Birthday! June 20th</h3>
            <img src="Images/Birthday.jpg">
            <p>The Tetons are known for their three large defined peaks (seen in the first image), but Mt. Moran is my favorite. Recognizable by it's flat top, it is balanced, beautiful, and grounding.</p>
            <h3>Sunrise at Jackson Lake Lodge, 2022</h3>
            <img src="Images/Sunrise2022.jpg">
            <p>I'm not a morning person, but I will always wake up early for a mountain sunrise :)</p>
            <h3>Sunrise at Signal Mountain, 2017</h3>
            <img src="Images/SignalMnt.jpg">
            <p>Fun fact: I have been to The Tetons five times.</p>
            <h3>Delta Lake, 2022</h3>
            <img src="Images/DeltaLake.jpg">
            <p>When I was 16, my uncle decided to take my mother, my brother, and I on our first road trip out west. Ever since this trip, I have been chasing the mountains.</p>
